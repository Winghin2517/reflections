When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Because if your computer is lost, your work would also be lost and it would be safer to work on a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you can control what new code you are pulling.
