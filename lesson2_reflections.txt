What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You get a .git hidden folder in your directory. You will need it to store your files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area groups the docs you want to commit all at the same time. This helps in grouping your docs to ensure that there is some order per commit.
