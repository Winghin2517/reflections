How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You could see the difference between them and then decide whether the change was accurate or not.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    You could evaluate whether your changes were good or not.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    You control what you want to save and not save and possibly it cuts down on overheads.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Don't really know...I guess git deals with code so it is a function of its nature.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    I use FC on Windows to see the changes made to a file. But git log and git diff 
    lets me see the diff in the commits and the git log shows me a listing of all the commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    It could allow me to roll back the changes made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Everything.
